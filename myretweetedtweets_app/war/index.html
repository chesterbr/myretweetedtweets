	<h1>My Retweeted Tweets</h1>
	<p>This application makes the last tweets you wrote that someone
		retweeted available as a widget that you can embed it in your blog,
		profile, etc. (and also as JSON, so you can retrieve them anywhere)</p>
	<p>
		To begin, you need first to <a href="/beginauth">authorize the app</a>
		on Twitter. Go ninja, go ninja, go!
	</p>
	<hr style= />
	<p>
		<b>WARNING</b>: It will make the retweeted tweets available to anyone
		that have (or can guess) the URL. Not a real security issue, since
		they were supposed to be public anyway - but if that is a concern for
		you, don't use the app.
	</p>
	<p>
		The service is hosted on <a href="http://appengine.google.com">Google
			App Engine</a> and the <a
			href="http://github.com/chesterbr/myretweetedtweets">source code</a>
		is available under the <a
			href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache
			License</a> on GitHub. It is provided with no warranties other than my
		good will.
