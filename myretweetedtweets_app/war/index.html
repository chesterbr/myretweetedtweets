	<h1>My Retweeted Tweets</h1>
	<p>This application makes the last tweets you wrote that someone
		retweeted available as JSON (other formats may be done if someone
		needs them), so you can embed it in your blog, profile, etc.</p>
	<p>
		To begin, you need first to <a href="/beginauth">authorize the app</a>
		on Twitter. Go ninja, go ninja, go!
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>
		<b>WARNING</b>: It will make the retweeted tweets available to anyone
		that have (or can guess) the URL. Not a real security issue, since
		they were supposed to be public anyway - but if that is a concern for
		you, don't use the app.
