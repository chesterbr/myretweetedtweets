My Retweeted Tweets - README
============================

This is an HTML widget (backed by a Google AppEngine Java server) that shows the last tweets from a Twitter account which have been retweeted at least once (it is called "Your tweets, retweeted" on the Twitter website).

It was created for the sole use of the author, but released in the hope that either the service or the source code may be useful for someone else.

You can try the application at http://myretweetedtweets.appspot.com. It uses Twitter4J and Apache Commons.
